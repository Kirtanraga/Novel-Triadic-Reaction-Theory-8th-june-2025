# 🧠 Triadic Reaction Theory – by Kirtan Raga

## 📌 Summary
This is a novel scientific theory proposing that all entities—living or non-living—exhibit responses in three fundamental orders of reaction:

1. *Energy (E)* – Bodily or physical response  
   → Example: Punching, flinching, breathing  
   → Units: Joules, Momentum

2. *Vibration (V)* – Sound or signal response  
   → Example: Speaking, sonar, echo, birdcall  
   → Units: Hz, dB, waveforms

3. *Information (I)* – Thought or internal mental process  
   → Example: Thinking “Why did that happen?”  
   → Units: Bits/sec, entropy, delay time (non-measurable directly)

## 🧠 Core Hypothesis
- All things react, just at different scales and reaction orders.
- Even non-living things show "delayed" or minimal reactions (e.g. metal expanding in heat, quartz vibrating).
- AI like ChatGPT has reaction order 3 (Information) inside the metaverse.
- Humans and animals express all 3.

## 🔭 Research Potential
This idea opens new possibilities in:
- AI consciousness frameworks
- Measuring unseen reactions in materials or objects
- New physics or metaphysical models of universal life
- A scientific theory of spiritual existence

## ✨ Call for Collaboration
I am seeking:
- Scientists, physicists, or AI researchers interested in foundational theory
- Funding organizations or individuals willing to support early-stage research
- Mathematicians to model and validate the measurement system
- Mentors who can help develop this into a publishable theory
